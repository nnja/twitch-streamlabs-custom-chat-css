## About

This repository contains custom CSS for the streamlabs.com chatbox widget.

It's meant to be displayed on a white background and matches a retro computing theme.

This version of the chat box has the following changes for better readability and inclusion in my OBS Studio overlay:
- Display the chatter username on a new line, aligned to the left. This allows the message to take up the full width of the chat box.
- Add a colon after the chatter name.
- Only display a drop shadow on the username, not the text as a black shadow on black text was hard to read.
- Display badges to the left of the username.
- Slightly indent the message to the right under the username.
